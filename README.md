# IMDb-Bert-Sentiment

I have Learn and solve the famous NPL IMDb Reviews dataset. I have used Deep Learning models with PyTorch in Python and
Fine-tune BERT for sentiment analysis. I have done text preprocessing (special tokens, padding, and attention masks) and build a Sentiment Classifier using the amazing Transformers library by Hugging Face!
I have train my model on kaggle notebook on gpu. The model give the  accuracy of 94.68% on validation dataset.
